# starfleet
An example project to test features of the Kubernetes ecosystem

Its hard to try out new things with Kubernetes with no code and no pods. 
This example project has two microservices backed by two databases, a flask based web frontend and a call to a cloud service. 
The amount of code is minimal - the point being to just get something (fun) running in a pod that can use various K8s features.
